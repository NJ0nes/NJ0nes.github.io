<p>
In this project for MAT 553, I investigated the returns of registered index-linked annuities.
Registered index-linked annuities (RILAs) are a new type of investment vehicle that
  provides exciting potential for growth with some protection from downside risk.
The key difference between a RILA and a traditional fixed income annuity is that the
  return of the RILA depends on the performance of its linked index.
Allianz Life, a large and well-known financial institution, offers several RILA
  products, each with different methods of determining the credited interest rate.
The goal of this project was to model the returns of these products, define a probability
  distribution for the returns, and finally to make a recommendation on which product
  to pick for a six-year long crediting period.
</p>

<p>
The RILAs in question are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index.
Thus, the first task was to simulate the return of the S&P 500 over the next
  six years.
To do this, I modeled the S&P 500 as geometric Brownian motion and ran
  10,000 simulations of its returns.
  
To estimate the parameters <em>μ</em> and <em>σ</em>, I used their
  maximum likelihood estimators obtained from the daily closing
  price of the SPY exchange-traded fund from the start of 2003 to
  the end of 2023.
Once the parameters were obtained, I simulated the S&P 500 for
  1512 days using a standard Euler-Maryuama method.

<p>
The recommendation was meant for a person nearing retirement, so downside risk
  was a serious concern.
This meant that it would be worth sacrificing the highest end of returns to gain
  safety, so I focused on the bottom 10% of returns for the annuities in my
  analysis.
In particular, I measured the 0.1%, 1%, and 10% worst returns against the likelihood
  of beating a fixed instrument that offers a 5.2% annual return (cumulative 35.5%)
  over 6 years.
By this metric, I recommended the Index Performance 1-Year Term with 20% buffer.
