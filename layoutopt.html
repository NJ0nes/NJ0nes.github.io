<p>
In this project for MAT 552, I designed a method to find a layout of locations that minimizes the
  total distance traveled for a given route across them with repeat visits in 1 dimension.
The problem was originally envisioned as a method for profile-guided optimization in
  a compiler, the idea being that functions or data could be automatically placed in
  memory to maximize cache locality for a known access pattern.
However, I was also interested in the problem as a sort of inversion of the traveling
  salesman problem.
In the TSP, the locations are fixed and the goal is to find the route; in my problem,
  the route is fixed and the goal is to find the locations.

            the points most frequently moved between are given a high rank,
            so the algorithm prioritizes placing them together.</figcaption>

            search in 10,000 runs with random traversal sequences. The algorithm is able to quickly find near-optimal layouts in nearly
            all cases.</figcaption>
