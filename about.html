                  <p>Hi, I'm Nathaniel Jones.
                  I graduated from West Chester University of Pennsylvania in May 2024
                  with an M.S. in Applied & Computational Mathematics. Mathematical modeling
                  is a great passion of mine, and I love to solve challenging problems.
                  I'm also fascinated by computers and how they can be used to make
                  people's lives better.
                  Outside of studying math, I like to read nonfiction and to listen to music.</p>
