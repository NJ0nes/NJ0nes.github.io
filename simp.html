<p>
In this project, I implemented the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) model
  for topology optimization in FORTRAN 90.
The goal was to create the most rigid possible structure for a bracket mounted to
  a wall on the left that bears a load on the bottom right.
To do this, the compliance of the structure is computed in each iteration and
  the amount of material in each grid cell changed so as to reduce the compliance
  in the next iteration subject to a volume constraint.
Additionally, I performed a sensitivity analysis of final compliance against changes
  in the volume constraint and changes in the penalty term of SIMP.

<p>
As part of the implementation of SIMP, the FORTRAN code also contains a basic implementation
  of the simplex method, which is used to minimize compliance, and a basic implementation of
  Cholesky decomposition, which is used during the computation of compliance.
