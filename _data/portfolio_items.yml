  description: >
    Neural networks trained to solve the 1D viscous Burgers' equation and experiments
    on learning rate, network structure, activation functions, and incomplete initial
    conditions. Implemented in MATLAB.

  detailpage: rilas.html
  description: >
    Analysis of the distribution of returns for registered index-linked annuities
    (RILAs) offered by Allianz. The returns are computed via a simulation of the
    S&P 500 index modeled as GBM, with parameters estimated from historical data.
    Implemented in R.

  detailpage: simp.html
  description: >
    An implementation of the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) model
    to maximize the rigidity of a load-bearing bracket mounted to a wall. Implemented
    in FORTRAN 90.
