<p>
In this project, I led a team to study the use of physics-informed neural networks
  to solve an IBVP governed by the 1D viscous Burgers' equation.
Starting from example code provided by MATLAB, we examined the effects of network
  structure, activation functions, learning rate, batch size, and more on the
  network output.

                with the Swish activation function after 1,000 epochs. The activation
                function for each layer had a learnable parameter affecting the shape
                of Swish for that layer.</figcaption>

We also compared our results with those obtained from a standard explicit finite
  difference method, and found that the neural network is unconditionally stable
  whereas the standard finite difference method requires careful tuning to achieve
  accurate results.
However, the robustness of PINNs come at a large training cost, albeit one that
  could be significantly reduced by training in parallel (GPU training was not
  available for our experiments).

<p>
Interestingly, it seems that PINNs can deliver a reasonable approximation to the
  solution of the IBVP even with an incomplete initial condition, which suggests
  PINNs as a useful technique for extrapolating from scattered data.

I was awarded first prize for my oral presentation on this project at the WCU Research
  and Creative Activity day on April 17th, 2024.
